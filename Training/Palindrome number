Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.
Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true

CODE::

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> int:
        if (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0): 
            return False
        back= 0
        while x > back:
            pop = x % 10
            x //= 10
            back = back * 10 + pop
        return x == back or x == back//10
