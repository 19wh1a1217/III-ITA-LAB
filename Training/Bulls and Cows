Given the secret number secret and your friend's guess guess, return the hint for your friend's guess.

The hint should be formatted as "xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

Example 1:

Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
"1807"
  |
"7810"

CODE::

class Solution:

    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:

        A = 0
        B = 0
        secret_list = ['']*len(secret)
        guess_list = ['']*len(guess)


        for i in range(len(secret)):
            secret_list[i] = secret[i]
            guess_list[i] = guess[i]

       
        for i in range(len(secret)):
            if secret[i] == guess[i]:
                A += 1
                secret_list.remove(secret[i])
                guess_list.remove(guess[i])

       
        for i in range(len(guess_list)):
            if guess_list[i] in secret_list:
                B += 1
                secret_list.remove(guess_list[i])


        str_ans = str(A) + "A" + str(B) + "B"

        return str_ans
