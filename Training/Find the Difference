You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

CODE::::(c++)
  class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        for (char c : s)
            a += c;
        for (char c : t)
            b += c;
            
        return b - a;
    }
};
