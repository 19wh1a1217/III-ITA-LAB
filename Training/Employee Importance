You have a data structure of employee information, including the employee's unique ID, importance value, and direct subordinates' IDs.
Given an integer id that represents an employee's ID, return the total importance value of this employee and all their direct and indirect subordinates.

 Input: employees = [[1,5,[2,3]],[2,3,[]],[3,3,[]]], id = 1
Output: 11
Explanation: Employee 1 has an importance value of 5 and has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3.
They both have an importance value of 3.
Thus, the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.


CODE:: cpp
class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<int,Employee*>m;
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {
        for(Employee* emp : employees) m[emp->id]=emp;
        return dfs(id);
    }
    int dfs(int id)
    {
        int ans =m[id]->importance;
        for(int subs : m[id]->subordinates){
            ans += dfs(subs);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
